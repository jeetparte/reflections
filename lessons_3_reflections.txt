1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Remote repositories are useful for working from multiple locations i.e. when
using multiple computers or when multiple users are contributing to the remote.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes can cause conflicts. If you're working on a new feature, manually
pulling allows the flexibility to choose when you want to keep up to date with
the latest version versus focus on completing the feature without having to
worry about solving new conflicts.
