**Reflections on Git and GitHub** - an integral part of Udacity's [*How to Use Git and GitHub* course][1]

I took the online course as a primer to understanding version control and Git - both of which were new to me at the time.   

For a better understanding of the concepts, the course authors encouraged [reflection-based learning][2] and so, 
as an adjunct to learning the main concepts, included this activity of reflecting on what was learnt, by answering a set 
of related questions.

**This repo contains my answers to those questions.**

**P.S.** It looks like Udacity has revamped their course. This refers to their older course.

**P.P.S. (Feb 2020)** After 3 years, it is interesting to look back at this. So I'm deciding to keep this repo.

### Next steps

At work, our team uses [Surround SCM][3] (although there are plans to migrate to git). But I do use git for personal projects like my upcoming blog.<!--todo - add link--> The [Pro Git][4] book is on my reading list for when I start using git more heavily.
