1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized with the 'git init' command, the repository is
placed under version control (using Git). It is a required as it lets Git know
that we want to track files in that repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only contains those files from the working directory and the
repository that have been added using the 'git add' command. The staging area
keeps track of changes in these files since the last commit. On using the commit
option, these changes are applied to the repository.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

We can do this by first adding the selected changed files in the working
directory to the staging area. And then, prior to using the 'git commit'
command, we can run the 'git diff --staged' command to see what changes are
going to be committed.
